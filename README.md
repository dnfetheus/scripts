# Scripts

There're some scripts that are useful for me (and might be for you).

## Installation

**TODO** ~~Just run [bootstrap.sh](bootstrap.sh) when using a Linux distro or [bootstrap.ps1](bootstrap.ps1) when using Windows 10.~~

Copy each script intended to use to their respective folders.

## Usage

Make sure that you had installed every scripts' dependencies needed to run and just execute them.
